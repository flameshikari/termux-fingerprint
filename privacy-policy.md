# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** August 25, 2025

## 1. Data Collection

My app does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal or usage data to the developer or any third parties. The app operates entirely offline and does not require or request access to your personal information.

## 2. Internet and Network Usage

The app does **not** access the internet or any external servers. The only network activity performed by the app is local:

- It may send requests to a helper server running on **localhost** (your own device).
- No data is sent or received from outside your device.

## 3. Information Sharing

Since the app does not collect any data and does not communicate outside your device, there is **no risk** of your data being shared with anyone.

## 4. Security

Because the app works exclusively offline and never transmits data beyond your device, your information remains fully private and secure.

## 5. Open Source

This app is **open source**. Its source code is publicly available and can be reviewed, audited, or modified by anyone to independently verify its privacy claims.

## 6. Policy Changes

This privacy policy will **not** change in the future, as the app will always operate offline and only communicate locally on your device.

## 7. Contact Me

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, you may contact me via email: `mail@hexed.pw`.
